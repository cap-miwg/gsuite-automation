      <p class="greeting">Dear {{rank}} {{lastName}},</p>
      
      <p><strong>Congratulations on turning 21!</strong> With this comes a lot of decisions to make about your membership and transforming from a Cadet to Senior. We hope this email will help with some of the confusion that always happens when Cadets turn Senior.</p>
      
      <p>You will still have to take Cadet Protection, so that does not change from when you turned 18 but there is so much more now that you are an "Adult."</p>
      
      <h2 class="section-header">FIRST THINGS YOU WILL NEED FOR BECOMING A SENIOR:</h2>
      
      <div class="checklist">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fingerprints:</strong> Get a fingerprint card from your Commander or see about ordering some off of eServices (your local Sheriff's office should be able to help with getting the fingerprints)</li>
          <li><strong><a href="https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/F_12_FAAE032949645.pdf" class="resource-link">CAPF12</a></strong> filled out and fingerprints mailed to National</li>
          <li><strong>Level 1 and 2</strong> to get your associated Senior Grade from what you ended up as a Cadet (this is a learning process with classes completed both in Absorb and in-person–yes, more homework now but it can be streamlined since you have been a Cadet!)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>A Great Resource: MIWG's Phoenix Senior Flight</strong><br><br>
        The unit holds meetings every other week where they go through classes to get you up to speed on what is needed for Level 1 and 2 to get your promotion. They are fully virtual and you do not need to transfer your membership–so you can stay at your home squadron! If this interests you, or you would like more information, don't hesitate to reach out to the Recruiting and Retention team and we can work on getting you added to the discord for meetings or assistance with the transition.

      <p>Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns with this next big step. If anyone in your unit has made the jump from Cadet to Senior, they are a great resource and mentor through this phase but we are more than happy to help as well.</p>
      
      <p>We understand that this can be a very challenging process during your current stage of life and making the process smoother for you is one of our goals at Wing. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions you may have and good luck on your future endeavors in CAP!</p>
